Viz for a Reddit post

Saw this data visualized yesterday [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5a7rya/arrests_at_nfl_games_by_home_team_oc/) and thought I would take a different look at it. 
[Data Source](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-nfl-arrests/blob/master/nfl_arrests_2011-2015.csv) 
Made with ggplot2 in R
